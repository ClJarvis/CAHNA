Southminster Presbyterian Church presented their plans for the property on W Longdale and Harding. This is the first of many meeting about their plans. They plan to expand their Daycare, add a coffee shop, and build a 60 unit space of affordable housing.</p>
    <p>The coffee shop would require rezoning for that building only. The other area would not need rezoning</p>
   

    <p>Here is the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pOJf059MV2ZMjE352Yl7EVY7P8J1l1zFIK4956w8iCw"> document they presented</a>. They handed a print out of this and it was on the QR code that was on screen during the slide show. Southminster has a form for questions or sign up for emails for their community updates and events, <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe6JCXqI-POyQwd8OfJMK6n6u5XSgrd4CIDAE4D0EFViSyMCg/viewform">Fill out the form here.</a> </p>

      <h3>Special Zoning Meeting Aug 18th 7:30PM</h3>

<p>Informational Meeting This Wednesday to Discuss an Amendment to the Southeast Community Plan
A very significant change to our neighborhood has been proposed for the area between Blackman and Elysian Fields along Trousdale Drive and on Harding from Trousdale east to Wauford Drive. This change would permanently affect the residential area of our neighborhood. The amendment is identified as 2021CP-012-002.</p>

<p>The Caldwell-Abbay Hall Neighborhood Association (CAHNA) Steering Committee learned about this proposed change to the Southeast Community Plan on August 10, 2021, from a neighbor in the affected area. The property owner for 444 Lynn Drive has requested this change.</p>

<p>Because this change affects our neighborhood and many more neighbors than just those in the proposed amendment area, CAHNA is hosting a virtual informational meeting on Wednesday, August 18, 2021, beginning promptly at 7:30 pm and ending promptly at 8:30 pm. We encourage everyone who can to attend this meeting. Again, this is an informational meeting.</p>

                  <b>Important Date Change:</b>
We are postponing our regular quarterly meeting from Saturday, January 19, 2019 to Monday evening, January 28, 2019, at 6:30 pm.  We will be meeting at Norman Binkley School.<br>

This change was necessary to accommodate Mayor Briley's schedule. As it turns out Governor Lee's inauguration falls on our Saturday meeting day and he was expected to be there. We believed this was a meeting worth accommodating for our neighbors in Caldwell Abbay Hall NA.<br>

Mayor Briley is interested in hearing from Nashville's residents about the budget. He would like input about what residents believe are important and want included in the budget.<br>

The mayor's staff will be taking notes as we share our thoughts about the budget and other concerns we may have regarding the city and city services.<br>

Please wear your CAHNA shirts if you have one. Let's show Mayor Briley our neighborhood pride!<br>

CAHNA will provide light snacks and drinks. Please RSVP on the Nextdoor calendar so we can have an idea of how much food to provide. <br>

I look forward to seeing everyone on Monday, January 28, 2019, at 6:30 pm at Norman Binkley Elementary School.
