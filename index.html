    <h2>Welcome to Caldwell-Abbay Hall</h2>

    <div id="welcome">

      <p>Welcome to Caldwell-Abbay Hall Neighborhood Association! We enjoy quiet residential streets, but we can hear an occasional monkey or flamingo from the zoo to our north. We celebrate the diversity of our neighbors: some of us have just bought our first home, others have lived here for 50 years; we are black and white, Kurdish and Hispanic. We are musicians, students, accountants, teachers, medical professionals, and more. Most of us like to garden a bit and we'll give you tips on what grows well here as you walk or drive by. We love to walk our dogs, jog and ride bikes on our safe streets. We are a mile from the interstate, 7 miles from Vandy, and less than 10 miles from downtown.</p>
      <p>The CAHNA is working hard to help preserve what we love about living here and to help make improvements that will benefit all of us. Attending the quarterly meetings gives you an opportunity to get to know some of your neighbors better, learn something new, and get involved in making our neighborhood better. We are well attended by our local council and state representatives who provide us with updates on state and local government changes. In 2010 we helped restock the clothes closet at Norman Binkley Elementary School. We look forward to continuing our support of this neighborhood school.<p>

    <h2>Traffic Calming Program</h2>

    <h3>Dear CAHNA Neighbors:</h3>


<P><b>We are excited that Caldwell-Abbay Hall was selected for the Metro Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program and we are preparing to engage Metro more deeply in this process.</b></P>

<P>First, a little background on how we got to this place. This conversation between Caldwell-Abbay Hall Neighborhood Association (CAHNA) dates back at least 4 years when we engaged Metro to deal with worsening traffic problems. Eventually, Metro solicited applications from neighborhoods for a new traffic calming initiative. CAHNA responded and was selected as one of eight neighborhoods out of a total field of more than 60 neighborhoods that applied. Over the last few years, Public Works has conducted traffic studies in our neighborhood. This spring, Metro asked CAHNA to collect feedback from neighbors. That information was shared with Metro (<a href="files/2019-Traffic-Calming-Feedback.xlsx" target="blank"> click here to view what we provided and Public Work’s feedback</a>). Metro evaluated the feedback in conjunction with the traffic studies to make recommendations for our neighborhood. Metro shared preliminary recommendations with the CAHNA Steering Committee. The Steering Committee displayed Metro’s recommendations at the May 18, Block Party (<a href="files/CAH_Preliminary_Plan_v2.pdf" target="blank">the same information can be found here</a>).</P>

<p><b>The next step is to host a community conversation at the CAHNA quarterly meeting – Saturday, July 20, at 10:00 a.m.</b> at Southminster Presbyterian Church. Derek Hagerty, with the Metro Public Works, will present their recommendations, solicit feedback, explain their process, and establish next steps. This meeting is not intended to be the final conversation. While Metro is guiding this process, at a minimum we know that it will take signatures from neighbors to approve any changes. Derek will explain this at the meeting.</p>

<p>Thanks for being a good neighbor and we hope to see you at the July meeting.</p>

Sincerely,<br>

The CAHNA Steering Committee<br>
