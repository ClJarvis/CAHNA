    <h2>Welcome to Caldwell-Abbay Hall</h2>


    <div id="welcome">
      <p>Welcome to Caldwell-Abbay Hall Neighborhood Association! We enjoy quiet residential streets, but we can hear an occasional monkey or flamingo from the zoo to our north. We celebrate the diversity of our neighbors: some of us have just bought our first home, others have lived here for 50 years; we are black and white, Kurdish and Hispanic. We are musicians, students, accountants, teachers, medical professionals, and more. Most of us like to garden a bit and we'll give you tips on what grows well here as you walk or drive by. We love to walk our dogs, jog and ride bikes on our safe streets. We are a mile from the interstate, 7 miles from Vandy, and less than 10 miles from downtown.</p>
      <p>The CAHNA is working hard to help preserve what we love about living here and to help make improvements that will benefit all of us. Attending the quarterly meetings gives you an opportunity to get to know some of your neighbors better, learn something new, and get involved in making our neighborhood better. We are well attended by our local council and state representatives who provide us with updates on state and local government changes. In 2010 we helped restock the clothes closet at Norman Binkley Elementary School. We look forward to continuing our support of this neighborhood school.<p>

      <p>Neighborhood Association

        Our regular meetings are at the Southminister Presbyterian Church on Harding and Danby. At 10:00 am on the third Saturday of each new quarter.
        2016 dates are:
        April 16
        July 16
        October 15
        We meet in the fellowship hall. Park in the parking area off W. Longdale.
