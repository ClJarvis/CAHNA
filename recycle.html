    <h2>Extra Cart, Extra fees</h2>
      <p>July 1, 2012<br>
      <strong>Trash Cart Fees for  More Than Two Carts</strong> - Public Works will begin phasing in fees for multiple trash carts at residences and businesses that use the brown trash carts for collection. Residents and businesses using more than two trash carts will be charged a collection and disposal fee for the additional trash. To receive collection of more than 2 trash containers,  customers will need to pay a monthly collection and disposal fee that reflects the actual cost to Public Works for collecting and disposing of that additional trash. </p>
      <p><em><strong>Public Works will provide  customers additional recycling carts and monthly collection of recycling  at no additional cost. </strong></em></p>
