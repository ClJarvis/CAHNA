      <p>We had great support from MNPD with 3 motorcycle patrols & Sgt. Hume in a patrol car. Several tickets were written but that was not the purpose of the rally. The purpose was to draw attention to the speed limit and ask drivers to slow down & be careful of pedestrians. </p>

  <p>Our house (4717 Vicar Drive) was broken into on October 30, 2014.  Wonder if it had anything to do with those guys who broke into that Mapco on Trousdale on Friday morning.  Anyway, my neighbor saw the car in my driveway around 12:15 in the afternoon.  It was a burgundy late 90s model Yukon.  If you want to pass that tidbit of info along, it might help someone else.</p>

 <p><strong>MNPD Increasing Visibility with Neighborhood Patrol Lights</strong><br>
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Police officers patrolling Nashville's neighborhoods are about to become more visible.<br>
    <br>
    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chief Steve Anderson today announced that new marked police cars are being equipped with light bars capable of displaying lower intensity non-flashing blue lights in a constant &quot;on&quot; position.  These lights, which are most noticeable during the evening and nighttime hours, can be activated separately from full emergency flashing blue lights. <br>
   "The Neighborhood Patrol Lights are designed to help citizens be aware when officers are proactively patrolling neighborhoods as well as serve as a deterrent to crime by also letting would-be lawbreakers know that we are in the area," Chief Anderson said.

   Twenty new marked police cars assigned to the recently opened Midtown Hills Precinct are now equipped with Neighborhood Patrol Lights. Replacement police cars received by all precincts in the future will be equipped with the system.

  <p><strong>Dog Shooting Investigation</strong><br>
  I heard from our community coordinator this afternoon. He stated that the dog shooting is being actively investigated and will provide me with updates when he has news. </p>
  <p><strong>Helicopters</strong><br>
    The helicopters were called in for the burglary in progress because the police believed the person of interest was still in the area. They called helicopters to search from the air for possible movement or an individual believed to be hiding. They did not find anyone. <br>
  FYI: If this situation happens again remain indoors with your doors locked. You may call the non-emergency number and ask them about the helicopters. Keep your eye out for any suspicious activity and report it immediately to the non-emergency number. Be as descriptive as possible. Color of clothing, # of individuals, emblems or designs on clothing, type of car &amp; color, if there is damage to the vehicle &amp; location of that damage, the direction they were traveling either on foot or in vehicle, etc. Every bit of information is helpful. Never place yourself at risk to obtain this information.</p>
  <p><b>July 31 2014</b></p>
  <p>We live in Abbay Hall. I wanted to let you know that someone shot our dog and killed her in our back yard yesterday while we were home. It was intentional based on the location of the bullet. We have filed a police report and the police are investigating. No one heard anything but whoever did it must have had access to a neighbor's back yard as ours is not accessible any other way. </p>
  <p>We are very worried about the safety of our other dogs/ neighbors dogs/ kids. We are offering a $500 reward for any information that leads to finding the person who did this.</p>
  <p>I am hoping this information is useful to the neighborhood watch. I was wondering if there is a way to get this information out to people in our neighborhood.</p>

Sgt Taylor Schmitz
Metro Nashville Police Department

Good morning and we hope you are having a good week and will have a safe upcoming weekend. After reviewing recent data we wanted to stress to everyone. This would include anyone who drives or rides in a vehicle. When leaving a vehicle unattended, whether it be in an apartment community, shopping center, grocery store or even the gas station, please be sure to secure your vehicle AND take items out of plain view. We have noticed an increase in vehicle break in’s in which purses and wallets are being taken. Leaving purses, backpacks, laptop bags, briefcases or any other bag in plain view entices a criminal to break in. Regardless of if there are contents in the bag or not, the criminal does not know this and all they see is a bag, which usually contains items of value. Just a friendly reminder before your busy weekend starts, secure all valuables in your vehicle and make sure they are OUT OF SIGHT.

    <h2>MNPD Urges Motorists & Pedestrians to Watch Out for Each Other</h2>


    <div id="welcome">


    In an effort to raise awareness regarding pedestrian safety, the MNPD’s Traffic Section, which investigates fatal crashes, is urging motorists and pedestrians to watch out for each other.

    In 2013, fifteen pedestrians died in fatal collisions. A contributing factor in six of those crashes was alcohol involvement on the part of the pedestrian. In nine deaths, a contributing factor was pedestrian in the roadway.
    <ul>
    <li>Safe pedestrian tips include:

    <ul>
    <li><b>Be Aware:</b></li>

    <li>· Be predictable. Follow the rules of the road and obey signs and signals.</li>
    <li>· Walk on sidewalks whenever they are available.</li>
    <li>· If there is no sidewalk, walk facing traffic and as far from traffic as possible.</li>
    <li>· Keep alert at all times-don’t be distracted by electronic devices.</li>
    <li>· Cross at crosswalks or intersections whenever possible.</li>


    <li>· Look for cars in all directions – including those turning left or right.</li>


    <li>· If a crosswalk or intersection is not available, locate a well-lit area, wait for a gap in traffic that allows you enough time to cross safely, and continue to watch for traffic as you cross.</li>
    </ul>

    <ul><b>Be Seen:</b>

    <li>· Never assume a driver sees you. Make eye contact with drivers as they approach.</li>
    <li>· Be visible at all times. Wear bright clothing during the day and reflective gear at night. Carry a flashlight.</li>
    <li>· Watch for cars entering or exiting driveways, or backing up in parking lots.</li>
    </ul>


    <ul><b>Arrive Alive:</b>
    <li>· Avoid alcohol and drugs when walking; they impair your abilities and judgment.</li>

    </ul></li>
    <P>
    <ul><b>Tips for motorists include:</b>
    <li>· Look out for pedestrians everywhere, at all times. Safety is a shared responsibility.</li>
    <li>· Use extra caution when driving in hard-to-see conditions.</li>
    <li>· Slow down and be prepared to stop when entering a crosswalk.</li>
    <li>· Yield to pedestrians in crosswalks.</li>
    <li>· Stop a safe distance from the crosswalk to give other vehicles an opportunity to see the crossing pedestrians.</li>
    <li>· Never pass vehicles stopped at a crosswalk. There may be people crossing that you can’t see.</li>
    <li>· Never drive under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs.</li>
    <li>· Follow the speed limit.</li>
    <li>· Obey speed limits in school zones and whereever children are present.</li>
    <li>· Be extra cautious when backing up – pedestrians can move into your path.</li>
    <li>· Motorists are also urged to exercise caution with school out for the summer and the increased number of children playing outside.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Be careful for who you open your doors</h2>


    <div id="welcome">
    One of our Neighbors sent in this report.


  I wanted to inform you of something that happened the other night in our neighborhood so you can warn others.

   My fiancee was home alone around 5pm last Thursday evening. She was getting ready to meet me at a client's house. It was dark and she heard some men laughing outside. At first she thought it was our neighbors. She looked out the window to see because their voices seemed awful close to our bathroom window. She could only see 2 figures in between our bathroom window and our front door. They were not on the sidewalk. They proceeded to knock on the door in which she asked who it was. One of the men said "Carlos". Being that she nor I know a Carlos, she told them they must have the wrong house. They insisted that they didn't. She then told them they would have to come back later. Their response was no, open the door. She refused to open the door and the men told her she needed to because they had a gun. She told them she had a gun and was calling the police. They remained outside the door talking and laughing in a sinister way. She called the police and in 5 minutes had 4 cop cars at our house. The men had fled after a couple of minutes. I am assuming they heard her calling the police and realized they better leave. I can only imagine what might have happened if she had innocently and naively opened the door. Or, what if she had left 10 minutes later and they were waiting outside?

   A few minutes later, a friend and neighbor called. He said that 2 men had come to their house to sell magazines but his wife told them to come back later. These men who did come back to their house. Their response when knocking was "we are the good guys and don't have guns". My assumption is the police must have talked to them.

   I hate to make assumptions but these men could have been pretending to sell magazines and looking to "scope out" homes for potential break ins. Or, it could have been 2 totally different men. Either way, we need to make our neighbors aware of what happened in order to prevent any possible future attacks.
